# AnotherCvLibForOfxOpenCv

Since the original ofxOpenCv addon bundled to [OpenFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) doesn't support some basic stuff (cv::imread, cv::imwrite with `.png` or `.jpg` export), here I placed modified version of static libralies.

## Usage

Simply you can download a library file to replace the one in ofxOpenCv, by using `wget` command or downloading the whole repo by `saving as zip` option.
